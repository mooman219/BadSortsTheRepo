# [Decksort]

# About the Sort

- This is a spin off of bogosort, imagine shuffling a deck of cards until they are sorted again. It can happen! It's very long but can happen!

# Pseudocode

```
decksort()

	while the inputed list isnt sorted
		divde the list into two

		do whatever you want to pick what half of the deck you want to start the shuffle with 

		if first half of the deck
			while the half lists arent put together
				pop the first item in firsthalf add it to your conjoined list
				pop the second item in secondhalf add it to your conjoined list
		else 
			while the half lists arent put together
				pop the second item in secondhalf add it to your conjoined list
				pop the first item in firsthalf add it to your conjoined list

		input list = the newly shuffled together list

	go until its sorted

```
